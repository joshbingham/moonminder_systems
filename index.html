  <section class="history" id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Life on the Moon was once a dream relegated to textbooks and sci-fi novels. By the late 21st century, advances in propulsion, habitat engineering, and artificial intelligence made sustained lunar living a reality. Early lunar outposts began as research stations, but as private companies and international coalitions expanded operations, permanent settlements emerged — complete with self-sustaining habitats, energy grids, and autonomous support systems.</p>
    <p>It was in this era of expansion, in the year 2112, that MoonMinder Systems was founded. Our mission was clear: to create intelligent companions that could assist humans in the unique challenges of lunar life. From monitoring life-support systems to providing companionship in the low-gravity isolation of the Moon, our robots were designed to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and the human need for connection.</p>
    <p>Over the decades, MoonMinder Systems evolved alongside the colonies. Each generation of companions became smarter, more adaptive, and more personable. Our innovations set the standard for lunar robotics, ensuring that life on the Moon could be both safe and enjoyable. Today, MoonMinder Systems continues to innovate — combining advanced Large Language Models, robotics, and human-centric design to make the Moon feel like home.</p>
